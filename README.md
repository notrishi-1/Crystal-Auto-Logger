# Crystal-Auto-Logger
This project is a lightweight Python application that automates login to the BMSCE student portal (Contineo) using Selenium. It features a clean Tkinter-based GUI for setting user credentials, performs an automatic login at launch, and provides a temporary edit window post-login. Designed for speed, convenience, and reuse.
